*what you would do if you have more time*
I managed to get recipes from the api and display it on the console, but not on the webpage
Properly finish it for starters. I couldnt get the weboage to show up yet, I would like to set up a route for it properly; I didnt pick the best approach for it.
Next, I'd like to make it responsive, and display the recipe picture along with its name.
Ultimately, make the search have only 1 text input, and have code handle if the input was a recipe name or an ingredient.
